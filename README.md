This API will allow users to quickly access information about their favorite artists, albums, and songs. We will include endpoints that track things like genre, release year, runtime, and more. Users will be able to specify tracks with unique Spotify or Apple Music track IDs, or they can choose to list tracks, albums, or artists based on many sorting and filtering options. Users will also be able to access real time hot charting tracks and albums!
